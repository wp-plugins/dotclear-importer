"Because both WordPress and DotClear uses a strong encryption hash with "
"passwords, it is impossible to decrypt it and we are forced to assign "
"temporary passwords to all your users.  <strong>Every user has the same "
"username, but their passwords are reset to password123.</strong>  So <a href="
